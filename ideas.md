* Users can create leagues & ladders
* One official league & ladder per game
* Advertise top leagues/ladders on frontpage
* Home/Away concepts are tied to servers?
* Maybe find a way to integrate directly with games to get game information
* Require each team submit a link to a video of their side playing
* Allow each player to submit a link to a video of them playing the match (increases credibility in dispute)
Setup a system where we connect to the server as a spectator to record the match and upload to youtube? maybe start * with only supporting like CS:GO?
* Auto/Manual mode for challenges
* Show history of ladder
* Should ladders have seasons?
* Rule -- allow player trades? allow player transfers between teams?
* COme up with a "Rules" concept, where you can turn on/off rules for ladder/league stuff -- config
	* Ladder - How many rungs you can challenge upwards / Percentage based?
	* League - How many weeks the league will be for
* Figure out a way to have esport specific metadata to allow for variation of games (ie change the map per week for league vs random map selection for ladders)
* Try to get player stats from matches to provide cool data back
* ladders only allow one challenge open for a team at a time
